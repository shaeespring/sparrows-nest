About Me
<br />
Hello! My name is Shaela Spring. I graduated from Portville Central High School
in 2024, but now I'm a Software Engineering student at RIT. I enjoy hanging
out with my friends at the Computer Science House, helping around radio stations
and learning new card or word games.

Things I would like to learn from SWEN 101:
-How to make this website look like a resume
-How to make a pretty website with functions and stuff
-What classes will teach me languages that I'll actually use in jobs
